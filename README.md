## Building
To build, you NEED to have *Steam*. That's all for global.

### Linux
To build on Linux, first you gotta get *podman*. It depends on your distro, actually. After that, just run `src/buildalterprojects`, and wait until it completes. Then, in the `game` directory, you will get the `altersrc_linux64` file. Run it, and boom!

### Windows
To build on Windows, first you gotta get *Visual Studio 2022*. Then, run `src/createalterprojects.bat`, and after the `.sln` file has generated, open it with *Visual Studio 2022*. Then, compile it by right clicking on the **Solution** and clicking Compile (or whatever you have, i don't use Visual Studio). Then, in the `game` directory, you will get the `altersrc_win64.exe` file. Run it, and boom!
